                "abstract": "The UniCarb KnowledgeBase (UniCarbKB; http://unicarbkb.org) offers public access to a growing, curated database of information on the glycan structures of glycoproteins. UniCarbKB is an international effort that aims to further our understanding of structures, pathways and networks involved in glycosylation and glyco-mediated processes by integrating structural, experimental and functional glycoscience information. This initiative builds upon the success of the glycan structure database GlycoSuiteDB, together with the informatic standards introduced by EUROCarbDB, to provide a high-quality and updated resource to support glycomics and glycoproteomics research. UniCarbKB provides comprehensive information concerning glycan structures, and published glycoprotein information including global and site-specific attachment information. For the first release over 890 references, 3740 glycan structure entries and 400 glycoproteins have been curated. Further, 598 protein glycosylation sites have been annotated with experimentally confirmed glycan structures from the literature. Among these are 35 glycoproteins, 502 structures and 60 publications previously not included in GlycoSuiteDB. This article provides an update on the transformation of GlycoSuiteDB (featured in previous NAR Database issues and hosted by ExPASy since 2009) to UniCarbKB and its integration with UniProtKB and GlycoMod. Here, we introduce a refactored database, supported by substantial new curated data collections and intuitive user-interfaces that improve database searching. \u00a9 2013 The Author(s).
