    "description": "An Error-correction Tool for Nanopore Sequencing Based on a Deep Learning Algorithm.\n\nNanopore sequencing is regarded as one of the most promising third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies. However, the nanopore sequencing reads are susceptible to a fairly high error rate owing to the difficulty in identifying the DNA bases from the complex electrical signals. Here we proposed a DNA basecalling reviser, NanoReviser, based on a deep learning algorithm to correct the basecalling errors introduced by current basecallers provided by default. In our module, we re-segmented the raw electrical signals based on the basecalled sequences provided by the default basecallers. By employing convolution neural networks (CNNs) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, we took advantage of the information from the raw electrical signals and the basecalled sequences from the basecallers.",
