    "description": "Optical classification of inland waters based on an improved Fuzzy C-Means method.\n\nWater optical clustering based on water color information is important for many ecological and environmental application studies, both regionally and globally. The fuzzy clustering method avoids the sharp boundaries in type-memberships produced by hard clustering methods, and thus presents its advantages. However, to make good use of the fuzzy clustering methods on water color spectra data sets, the determination of the fuzzifier parameter (m) of FCM (fuzzy c-means) is the key factor. Usually, the m is set to 2 by default. Unfortunately, this method assigned some membership degrees to non-belonging water type, failing to obtain the unitarity of cluster structure in some cases, especially in inland eutrophic water.",
