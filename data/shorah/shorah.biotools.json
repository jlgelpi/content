The high coverage achievable with these methods enables the detection of many low-frequency variants. However, sequencing errors complicate the analysis of mixed populations and result in inflated estimates of genetic diversity. We developed a probabilistic Bayesian approach to minimize the effect of errors on the detection of minority variants. We applied it to pyrosequencing data obtained from a 1.5kb-fragment of the HIV-1 gag/pol gene in two control and two clinical samples. The effect of PCR amplification was analysed. Error correction resulted in a two- and five-fold decrease of the pyrosequencing base substitution rate, from 0.05 to 0.03 and from 0.25 to 0.05 in the non-PCR and PCR-amplified samples, respectively. We were able to detect viral clones as rare as 0.1 with perfect sequence reconstruction. Probabilistic haplotype inference outperforms the counting-based calling method in both precision and recall. Genetic diversity observed within and between two clinical samples resulted in various patterns of phenotypic drug resistance and suggests a close epidemiological link. We conclude that pyrosequencing can be used to investigate genetically diverse samples with high accuracy if technical errors are properly treated. \u00a9 2010 The Author(s).",

The set of reads obtained from a deep sequencing experiment represents a statistical sample of the underlying population. We develop a generative probabilistic model for assigning observed reads to unobserved haplotypes in the presence of sequencing errors. This clustering problem is solved in a Bayesian fashion using the Dirichlet process mixture to define a prior distribution on the unknown number of haplotypes in the mixture. We devise a Gibbs sampler for sampling from the joint posterior distribution of haplotype sequences, assignment of reads to haplotypes, and error rate of the sequencing process, to obtain estimates of the local haplotype structure of the population.

                "abstract": "Background: Deep sequencing is a powerful tool for assessing viral genetic diversity. Such experiments harness the high coverage afforded by next generation sequencing protocols by treating sequencing reads as a population sample. Distinguishing true single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from sequencing errors remains challenging, however. Current protocols are characterised by high false positive rates, with results requiring time consuming manual checking.Results: By statistical modelling, we show that if multiple variant sites are considered at once, SNVs can be called reliably from high coverage viral deep sequencing data at frequencies lower than the error rate of the sequencing technology, and that SNV calling accuracy increases as true sequence diversity within a read length increases. We demonstrate these findings on two control data sets, showing that SNV detection is more reliable on a high diversity human immunodeficiency virus sample as compared to a moderate diversity sample of hepatitis C virus. Finally, we show that in situations where probabilistic clustering retains false positive SNVs (for instance due to insufficient sample diversity or systematic errors), applying a strand bias test based on a beta-binomial model of forward read distribution can improve precision, with negligible cost to true positive recall.Conclusions: By combining probabilistic clustering (implemented in the program ShoRAH) with a statistical test of strand bias, SNVs may be called from deeply sequenced viral populations with high accuracy. \u00a9 2013 McElroy et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",
