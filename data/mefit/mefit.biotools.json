For this analysis on the Illumina platform, merging and quality filtering of paired-end reads are essential first steps in data analysis to ensure the accuracy and reliability of downstream analysis. Results: We have developed the Merging and Filtering Tool (MeFiT) to combine these pre-processing steps into one simple, intuitive pipeline. MeFiT invokes CASPER (context-aware scheme for paired-end reads) for merging paired-end reads and provides users the option to quality filter the reads using the traditional average Q-score metric or using a maximum expected error cut-off threshold. Conclusions: MeFiT provides an open-source solution that permits users to merge and filter paired end illumina reads. The tool has been implemented in python and the source-code is freely available at https://github.com/nisheth/MeFiT.",
