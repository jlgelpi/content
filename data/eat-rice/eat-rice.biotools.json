                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Liao et al.T-DNA activation-tagging technology is widely used to study rice gene functions. When TDNA inserts into genome, the flanking gene expression may be altered using CaMV 35S enhancer, but the affected genes still need to be validated by biological experiment. We have developed the EAT-Rice platform to predict the flanking gene expression of T-DNA insertion site in rice mutants. The three kinds of DNA sequences including UPS1K, DISTANCE, and MIDDLE were retrieved to encode and build a forecast model of two-layer machine learning. In the first-layer models, the features nucleotide context (N-gram), cisregulatory elements (Motif), nucleotide physicochemical properties (NPC), and CG-island (CGI) were used to build SVM models by analysing the concealed information embedded within the three kinds of sequences. Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of gene activation which as feature-encoding weighting within first-layer model. In the second- layer models, the NaiveBayesUpdateable algorithm was used to integrate these first layer-models, and the system performance was 88.33% on 5-fold cross-validation, and 79.17% on independent-testing finally. In the three kinds of sequences, the model constructed by Middle had the best contribution to the system for identifying the activated genes. The EAT-Rice system provided better performance and gene expression prediction at further distances when compared to the TRIM database. An online server based on EATrice is available at http://predictor.nchu.edu.tw/EAT-Rice.",
