Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Even in the era of next generation sequencing, in which bioinformatics tools abound, annotating transcriptomes and proteomes remains a challenge. This can have major implications for the reliability of studies based on these datasets. Therefore, quality assessment represents a crucial step prior to downstream analyses on novel transcriptomes and proteomes. DOGMA allows such a quality assessment to be carried out. The data of interest are evaluated based on a comparison with a core set of conserved protein domains and domain arrangements. Depending on the studied species, DOGMA offers precomputed core sets for different phylogenetic clades. We now developed a web server for the DOGMA software, offering a user-friendly, simple to use interface. Additionally, the server provides a graphical representation of the analysis results and their placement in comparison to publicly available data. The server is freely available under https://domainworld-services.uni-muenster.de/dogma/. Additionally, for large scale analyses the software can be downloaded free of charge from https://domainworld.uni-muenster.de.",
