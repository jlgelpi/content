HX-Express generates deuterium uptake and peak width plots from peaks in mass spectral data. Data analysis is intentionally semi-automated, requiring that the user find the peaks to be analyzed. The peaks are entered in the form of x, y lists of m/z versus intensity or can be directly imported from Waters MassLynx software. Analysis of data with HX-Express provides the same results as manual data processing but is substantially faster. In addition to speed, HX-Express provides and preserves visual and numeric displays of the analysis process for quality control. \u00a9 2006 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.",

                "abstract": "Noisy and overlapped mass spectrometry data hinder the sequence coverage that can be obtained from hydrogen deuterium exchange analysis, and places a limit on the complexity of the samples that can be studied by this technique. Advances in instrumentation have addressed these limits, but as the complexity of the biological samples under investigation increases, these problems are re-encountered. Here we describe the use of binomial distribution fitting with asymmetric linear squares regression for calculating the accurate deuterium content for mass envelopes of low signal or that contain significant overlap. The approach is demonstrated with a test data set of HIV Env gp140 wherein inclusion of the new analysis regime resulted in obtaining exchange data for 42 additional peptides, improving the sequence coverage by 11 %. At the same time, the precision of deuterium uptake measurements was improved for nearly every peptide examined. The improved processing algorithms also provide an efficient method for deconvolution of bimodal mass envelopes and EX1 kinetic signatures. All these functions and visualization tools have been implemented in the new version of the freely available software, HX-Express v2.
