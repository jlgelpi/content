    "description": "Associating lncRNAs with small molecules via bilevel optimization reveals cancer-related lncRNAs.\n\nALACD is to get the drug-lncRNA assoications via bi-level optimization and decoded in R. It includes SVM standard algorithm for argumenting the genes' co-expressed lncRNAs (enhancering-lncRNA-mRNA-coexpression.R), and the optimization procedure for optimal identification of genes aassociated with both lncRNAs and drug to get the drug-lncRNA assoications (optimizating.R). crossvalSVM.R and getperf.R are for SVM cross-validtion and generating the evluation criteria, respectively. It also includes the DEGanalysis.R for differential expression analysis, and survival-analysis.R for surivival analysis of lncRNAs",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts have emerging impacts in cancer studies, which suggests their potential as novel therapeutic agents. However, the molecular mechanism behind their treatment effects is still unclear. Here, we designed a computational model to Associate LncRNAs with Anti-Cancer Drugs (ALACD) based on a bilevel optimization model, which optimized the gene signature overlap in the upper level and imputed the missing lncRNA-gene association in the lower level. ALACD predicts genes coexpressed with lncRNAs mean while matching drug\u2019s gene signatures. This model allows us to borrow the target gene information of small molecules to understand the mechanisms of action of lncRNAs and their roles in cancer. The ALACD model was systematically applied to the 10 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that had matched lncRNA and mRNA expression data. Cancer type-specific lncRNAs and associated drugs were identified. These lncRNAs show significantly different expression levels in cancer patients. Follow-up functional and molecular pathway analysis suggest the gene signatures bridging drugs and lncRNAs are closely related to cancer development. Importantly, patient survival information and evidence from the literature suggest that the lncRNAs and drug-lncRNA associations identified by the ALACD model can provide an alternative choice for cancer targeting treatment and potential cancer pognostic biomarkers.
