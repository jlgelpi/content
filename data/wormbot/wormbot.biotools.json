                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, American Aging Association.Caenorhabditis elegans is a popular organism for aging research owing to its highly conserved molecular pathways, short lifespan, small size, and extensive genetic and reverse genetic resources. Here we describe the WormBot, an open-source robotic image capture platform capable of conducting 144 parallel C. elegans survival and behavioral phenotyping experiments. The WormBot uses standard 12-well tissue culture plates suitable for solid agar media and is built from commercially available robotics hardware. The WormBot is controlled by a web-based interface allowing control and monitoring of experiments from any internet connected device. The standard WormBot hardware features the ability to take both time-lapse bright field images and real-time video micrographs, allowing investigators to measure lifespan, as well as heathspan metrics as worms age. The open-source nature of the hardware and software will allow for users to extend the platform and implement new software and hardware features. This extensibility, coupled with the low cost and simplicity of the system, allows the automation of C. elegans survival analysis even in small laboratory settings with modest budgets.",
