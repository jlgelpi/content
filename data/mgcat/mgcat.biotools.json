    "description": "For rapidly visualizing and aligning the most highly conserved regions in multiple genomes. It is based upon a highly efficient approach to anchor-based multiple genome comparison using a compressed suffix graph and thus can construct multiple genome alignment frameworks in closely related species usually in a few minutes. A couple of important limitations include (1) input sequences MUST be assembled, and (2) the comparison is reference-sequence biased.",

                "abstract": "Background: Due to recent advances in whole genome shotgun sequencing and assembly technologies, the financial cost of decoding an organism's DNA has been drastically reduced, resulting in a recent explosion of genomic sequencing projects. This increase in related genomic data will allow for in depth studies of evolution in closely related species through multiple whole genome comparisons. Results: To facilitate such comparisons, we present an interactive multiple genome comparison and alignment tool, M-GCAT, that can efficiently construct multiple genome comparison frameworks in closely related species. M-GCAT is able to compare and identify highly conserved regions in up to 20 closely related bacterial species in minutes on a standard computer, and as many as 90 (containing 75 cloned genomes from a set of 15 published enterobacterial genomes) in an hour. M-GCAT also incorporates a novel comparative genomics data visualization interface allowing the user to globally and locally examine and inspect the conserved regions and gene annotations. Conclusion: M-GCAT is an interactive comparative genomics tool well suited for quickly generating multiple genome comparisons frameworks and alignments among closely related species.
