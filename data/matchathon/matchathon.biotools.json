    "description": "A guide to student-faculty connections in PhD programs.\n\nR Shiny app to match two sets of people based on mutual interests (e.g. students and faculty based on research interest).\n\nCreated for the Matchathon event for the Program in Biomedical Sciences (PIBS) incoming first-year student Matchathon event.\n\nTo help students find faculty members with mutual research interests, we use this algorithm to match first-year PhD students and faculty who are in search of trainees based on mutual research interests. Then these students and faculty meet during a two hour Matchathon event. At the event students meet individually with 12 different faculty members for 5 minutes each.",
