                "abstract": "\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).Background: Abiotic and biotic stresses severely affect the growth and reproduction of plants and crops. Determining the critical molecular mechanisms and cellular processes in response to stresses will provide biological insight for addressing both climate change and food crises. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a revolutionary tool that has been used extensively in plant stress research. However, no existing large-scale RNA-Seq database has been designed to provide information on the stress-specific differentially expressed transcripts that occur across diverse plant species and various stresses. Results: We have constructed a comprehensive database, the plant stress RNA-Seq nexus (PSRN), which includes 12 plant species, 26 plant-stress RNA-Seq datasets, and 937 samples. All samples are assigned to 133 stress-specific subsets, which are constructed into 254 subset pairs, a comparison between selected two subsets, for stress-specific differentially expressed transcript identification. Conclusions: PSRN is an open resource for intuitive data exploration, providing expression profiles of coding-transcript/lncRNA and identifying which transcripts are differentially expressed between different stress-specific subsets, in order to support researchers generating new biological insights and hypotheses in molecular breeding or evolution.
