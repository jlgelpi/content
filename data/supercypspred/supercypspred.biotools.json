    "description": "web server for the prediction of cytochrome activity.\n\nSuperCYPsPred - a web server for the prediction of cytochrome activity; AG Preissner; Charit\u00e9 Berlin.\n\nDrug metabolism via the cytochrome P450 system has emerged as an important determinant in the occurrence of several drug interactions that can result in drug toxicities, reduced pharmacological effect, and adverse drug reactions. Recognizing whether the drugs involved act as enzyme substrates, inducers, or inhibitors can prevent clinically significant interactions from occurring. The SuperCYPsPred web server is focused on five major CYPs isoforms, including 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, that are responsible for more than 90% of the metabolism of clinical drugs. Besides the predictions, the web server provides literature curated details on known cytochrome interaction network of approved drugs.",
