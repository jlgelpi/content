    "description": "An Online Prognostic Biomarker Analysis Tool for Low-Grade Glioma.\n\nGlioma is the most frequent primary brain tumor that causes high mortality and morbidity with poor prognosis. There are four grades of gliomas, I to IV, among which grade II and III are low-grade glioma (LGG). Although less aggressive, LGG almost universally progresses to high-grade glioma and eventual causes death if lacking of intervention. Current LGG treatment mainly depends on surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but the survival rates of LGG patients are low. Therefore, it is necessary to use prognostic biomarkers to classify patients into subgroups with different risks and guide clinical managements. Using gene expression profiling and long-term follow-up data, we established an Online consensus Survival analysis tool for LGG named OSlgg. OSlgg is comprised of 720 LGG cases from two independent cohorts",
