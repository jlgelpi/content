For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: Template-based and template-free methods have both been widely used in predicting the structures of protein-protein complexes. Template-based modeling is effective when a reliable template is available, while template-free methods are required for predicting the binding modes or interfaces that have not been previously observed. Our goal is to combine the two methods to improve computational protein-protein complex structure prediction. Results: Here, we present a method to identify and combine high-confidence predictions of a template-based method (SPRING) with a template-free method (ZDOCK). Cross-validated using the protein-protein docking benchmark version 5.0, our method (ZING) achieved a success rate of 68.2%, outperforming SPRING and ZDOCK, with success rates of 52.1% and 35.9% respectively, when the top 10 predictions were considered per test case. In conclusion, a statistics-based method that evaluates and integrates predictions from template-based and template-free methods is more successful than either method independently.",
