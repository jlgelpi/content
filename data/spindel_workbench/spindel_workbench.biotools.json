                "abstract": "The quest for a universal and efficient method of identifying species has been a longstanding challenge in biology. Here, we show that accurate identification of species in all domains of life can be accomplished by multiplex analysis of variable-length sequences containing multiple insertion/deletion variants. The new method, called SPInDel, is able to discriminate 93.3 of eukaryotic species from 18 taxonomic groups. We also demonstrate that the identification of prokaryotic and viral species with numeric profiles of fragment lengths is generally straightforward. A computational platform is presented to facilitate the planning of projects and includes a large data set with nearly 1800 numeric profiles for species in all domains of life (1556 for eukaryotes, 105 for prokaryotes and 130 for viruses). Finally, a SPInDel profiling kit for discrimination of 10 mammalian species was successfully validated on highly processed food products with species mixtures and proved to be easily adaptable to multiple screening procedures routinely used in molecular biology laboratories. These results suggest that SPInDel is a reliable and cost-effective method for broad-spectrum species identification that is appropriate for use in suboptimal samples and is amenable to different high-throughput genotyping platforms without the need for DNA sequencing. \u00a9 2010 The Author(s).",

                "abstract": "The majority of the available methods for the molecular identification of species use pairwise sequence divergences between the query and reference sequences (DNA barcoding). The presence of multiple insertions and deletions (indels) in the target genomic regions is generally regarded as a problem, as it introduces ambiguities in sequence alignments. However, we have recently shown that a high level of species discrimination is attainable in all taxa of life simply by considering the length of hypervariable regions defined by indel variants. Each species is tagged with a numeric profile of fragment lengths-a true numeric barcode. In this study, we describe a multifunctional computational workbench (named SPInDel for SPecies Identification by Insertions/Deletions) to assist researchers using variable-length DNA sequences, and we demonstrate its applicability in molecular ecology. The SPInDel workbench provides a step-by-step environment for the alignment of target sequences, selection of informative hypervariable regions, design of PCR primers and the statistical validation of the species-identification process. In our test data sets, we were able to discriminate all species from two genera of frogs (Ansonia and Leptobrachium) inhabiting lowland rainforests and mountain regions of South-East Asia and species from the most common genus of coral reef fishes (Apogon). Our method can complement conventional DNA barcoding systems when indels are common (e.g. in rRNA genes) without the required step of DNA sequencing.
