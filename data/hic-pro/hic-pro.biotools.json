    "description": "This tool was designed to process Hi-C data, from raw fastq files (paired-end Illumina data) to the normalized contact maps. Since version 2.7.0, it can analyze data from digestion protocols as well as data from protocols that do not require restriction enzyme such as DNase Hi-C. The pipeline is flexible, scalable and optimized. It can operate either on a single laptop or on a computational cluster using the PBS-Torque scheduler.",

HiC-Pro maps reads, detects valid ligation products, performs quality controls and generates intra- and inter-chromosomal contact maps. It includes a fast implementation of the iterative correction method and is based on a memory-efficient data format for Hi-C contact maps. In addition, HiC-Pro can use phased genotype data to build allele-specific contact maps. We applied HiC-Pro to different Hi-C datasets, demonstrating its ability to easily process large data in a reasonable time.
