                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.Identification of orthologous or paralogous relationships of coding genes is fundamental to all aspects of comparative genomics. For accurate identification of orthologs among deeply diversified bilaterian lineages, precise estimation of gene trees is indispensable, given the complicated histories of genes over millions of years. By estimating gene trees, orthologs can be identified as members of an orthogroup, a set of genes descended from a single gene in the last common ancestor of all the species being considered. In addition to comparisons with a given species tree, purposeful taxonomic sampling increases the accuracy of gene tree estimation and orthogroup identification. Although some major phylogenetic relationships of bilaterians are gradually being unraveled, the scattering of published genomic data among separate web databases is becoming a significant hindrance to identification of orthogroups with appropriate taxonomic sampling. By integrating more than 250 metazoan gene models predicted in genome projects, we developed a web tool called ORTHOSCOPE to identify orthogroups of specific protein-coding genes within major bilaterian lineages. ORTHOSCOPE allows users to employ several sequences of a specific molecule and broadly accepted nodes included in a user-specified species tree as queries and to evaluate the reliability of estimated orthogroups based on topologies and node support values of estimated gene trees. A test analysis using data from 36 bilaterians was accomplished within 140 s. ORTHOSCOPE results can be used to evaluate orthologs identified by other stand-alone programs using genome-scale data. ORTHOSCOPE is freely available at https://www.orthoscope.jp or https://github.com/jun-inoue/orthoscope (last accessed December 28, 2018).",
