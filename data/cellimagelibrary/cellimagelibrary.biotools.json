    "description": "This Image Library is a repository for images and movies of cells from a variety of organisms. It demonstrates cellular architecture and functions with high quality images, videos, and animations. This comprehensive and easily accessible Library is designed as a public resource first and foremost for research, and secondarily as a tool for education. The long-term goal is the construction of a library of images that will serve as primary data for research.",

As a repository for microscopy data, it accepts all forms of cell imaging from light and electron microscopy, including multi-dimensional images, Z- and time stacks in a broad variety of raw-data formats, as well as movies and animations. The software design of CIL-CCDB was intentionally designed to allow easy incorporation of new technologies and image formats as they are developed. Currently, CIL-CCDB contains over 9250 images from 358 different species. Images are evaluated for quality and annotated with terms from 14 different ontologies in 16 different fields as well as a basic description and technical details. Since its public launch on 9 August 2010, it has been designed to serve as not only an archive but also an active site for researchers and educators. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2012.",
