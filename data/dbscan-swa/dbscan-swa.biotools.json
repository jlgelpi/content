    "description": "DBSCAN-SWA is a tool for rapid prophage detection and annotation\n\nBacteriophages are viruses that specifically infect bacteria and the infected bacteria are called bacterial hosts of the viruses. Passive replication of the bacteriophage genome relies on integrate into the host's chromosome and becoming a prophage. Prophages coexist and co-evolve with bacteria in the natural environment, having an impact on the entire ecological environment. Therefore, it is very essential to develop effective and accurate tools for identification of prophages. DBSCAN-SWA, a command line software tool developed to predict prophage regions in bacterial genomes, running faster than any previous tools and presenting great detection power based on the analysis using 184 manually curated prophages.",
