                "abstract": "\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).Background: Broad implementation of model-based dose-finding methods, such as the continual reassessment method (CRM), has been limited, with traditional or modified 3 + 3 designs remaining in frequent use. Part of the reason is the lack of reliable, easy-to-use, and robust software tools for designing and implementing more efficient designs. Results: With the aim of augmenting broader implementation of model-guided methods, we have developed a web application for the Bayesian CRM in the R programming language using the Shiny package. The application has two components, simulation and implementation. Within the application, one has the ability to generate simulated operating characteristics for the study design phase, and to sequentially provide the next dose recommendation for each new accrual or cohort based on the current data for the study implementation phase. At the conclusion of the study, it can be used to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The web tool requires no programming knowledge, and it is free to access on any device with an internet browser. Conclusions: The application provides the type of simulation information that aid clinicians and reviewers in understanding operating characteristics for the accuracy and safety of the CRM, which we hope will augment phase I trial design. We believe that the development of this software will facilitate more efficient collaborations within study teams conducting single-agent dose-finding trials.",
