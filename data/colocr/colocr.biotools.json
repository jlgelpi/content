It is often used to determine the co-distribution of two proteins inside the cell, suggesting that these two proteins could be functionally or physically associated. The limiting step in conducting microscopy image analysis in a graphical interface tool is the selection of the regions of interest for the co-localization of two proteins. Implementation. This package provides a simple straightforward workflow for loading fluorescence images, choosing regions of interest and calculating co-localization measurements. Included in the package is a shiny app that can be invoked locally to interactively select the regions of interest where two proteins are co-localized. Availability. colocr is available on the comprehensive R archive network, and the source code is available on GitHub under the GPL-3 license as part of the ROpenSci collection, https://github.com/ropensci/colocr.",
