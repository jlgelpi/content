                "abstract": "\u00a9 2017, The Author(s).CAS (Cell Annotation Software) is a novel tool for analysis of microscopic images and selection of the cell soma or nucleus, depending on the research objectives in medicine, biology, bioinformatics, etc. It replaces time-consuming and tiresome manual analysis of single images not only with automatic methods for object segmentation based on the Statistical Dominance Algorithm, but also semi-automatic tools for object selection within a marked region of interest. For each image, a broad set of object parameters is computed, including shape features and optical and topographic characteristics, thus giving additional insight into data. Our solution for cell detection and analysis has been verified by microscopic data and its application in the annotation of the lateral geniculate nucleus has been examined in a case study.",
