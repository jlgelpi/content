Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: In vivo protein folding is governed by molecular chaperones, that escort proteins from their translational birth to their proteolytic degradation. In E.coli the main classes of chaperones that interact with the nascent chain are trigger factor, DnaK/J and GroEL/ES and several authors have performed whole-genome experiments to construct exhaustive client lists for each of these. Results: We constructed a database collecting all publicly available data of experimental chaperone-interaction and-dependency data for the E.coli proteome, and enriched it with an extensive set of protein-specific as well as cell context-dependent proteostatic parameters. We made this publicly accessible via a web interface that allows to search for proteins or chaperone client lists, but also to profile user-specified datasets against all the collected parameters. We hope this will accelerate research in this field by quickly identifying differentiating features in datasets.",
