                "abstract": "Genotype imputation is now an essential tool in the analysis of genomewide association scans. This technique allows geneticists to accurately evaluate the evidence for association at genetic markers that are not directly genotyped. Genotype imputation is particularly useful for combining results across studies that rely on different genotyping platforms but also increases the power of individual scans. Here, we review the history and theoretical underpinnings of the technique. To illustrate performance of the approach, we summarize results from several gene mapping studies. Finally, we preview the role of genotype imputation in an era when whole genome resequencing is becoming increasingly common. Copyright \u00a9 2009 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.",
