                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s).We proposed a generic template-derived approach for (semi-) automated brain extraction in animal MRI studies and evaluated our implementation with different animal models (macaque, marmoset, rodent) and MRI protocols (T1, T2). While conventional MR-neuroimaging studies perform brain extraction as an initial step priming subsequent image-registration from subject to template, our proposed approach propagates an anatomical template to (whole-head) individual subjects in reverse order, which is challenging due to the surrounding extracranial tissue, greater differences in contrast pattern and larger areas with field inhomogeneity. As a novel approach, the herein introduced brain extraction algorithm derives whole-brain segmentation using rigid and non-rigid deformation based on unbiased anatomical atlas building with a priori estimates from study-cohort and an initial approximate brain extraction. We evaluated our proposed method in comparison to several other technical approaches including \u201cMarker based watershed scalper\u201d, \u201cBrain-Extraction-Tool\u201d, \u201c3dSkullStrip\u201d, \u201cPrimatologist-Toolbox\u201d, \u201cRapid Automatic Tissue Segmentation\u201d and \u201cRobust automatic rodent brain extraction using 3D pulse-coupled neural networks\u201d with manual skull-stripping as reference standard. ABX demonstrated best performance with accurate (\u226592%) and consistent results throughout datasets and across species, age and MRI protocols. ABX was made available to the public with documentation, templates and sample material (https://www.github.com/jlohmeier/atlasBREX).",
