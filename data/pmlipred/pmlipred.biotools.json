    "description": "PmliPred is a method based on hybrid model and fuzzy decision for plant miRNA-lncRNA interaction prediction.\n\nWe have proposed a new method for fulfilling plant miRNA-lncRNA interaction prediction (PmliPred). The deep learning model and shallow machine learning model are trained using raw sequences and manually extracted features respectively. Then they are hybridized based on fuzzy decision for prediction. PmliPred shows a better performance and generalization ability comparing with the existing methods. Several new miRNA-lncRNA interactions in Solanum lycopersicum are successfully identified using quantitative RT-PCR from the candidates predicted by PmliPred, which further verifies its effectiveness.",
