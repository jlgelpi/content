                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2016.Analysis of signaling pathways and their crosstalk is a cornerstone of systems biology. Thousands of papers have been published on these topics. Surprisingly, there is no database that carefully and explicitly documents crosstalk between specific pairs of signaling pathways. We have developed XTALKDB (http://www.xtalkdb.org) to fill this very important gap. XTALKDB contains curated information for 650 pairs of pathways from over 1600 publications. In addition, the database reports the molecular components (e.g. proteins, hormones, microRNAs) that mediate crosstalk between a pair of pathways and the species and tissue in which the crosstalk was observed. The XTALKDB website provides an easy-to-use interface for scientists to browse crosstalk information by querying one or more pathways or molecules of interest.",
