    "description": "An Integrative De Novo Variant Knowledge Base for Developmental Disorders.\n\nNeuroPsychiatric Mutation Knowledge Base.\n\nWelcome to our open access database PsyMuKB.\n\nPsyMuKB is a comprehensive knowledge base that links transcriptional and translational annotations to de novo variants, which are found in subjects but not in their parents, in developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Large-scale genomic and proteomic data are integrated into PsyMuKB, including developmental brain expressions, neuronal single-cell transcriptome, regulatory elements, and transcript annotations, protein-protein interactions (PPI) and protein isoform expressions. It aims to provide users with a comprehensive data exploration of de novo variants, such as their genomic locations on alternatively spliced isoforms, expression patterns of the mutation-disrupted genes and/or isoforms, and interaction network of impacted proteins",
