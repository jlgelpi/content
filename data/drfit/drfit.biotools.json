                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: Analyses of replicates in sets of discrete data, typically acquired in multi-well plate formats, is a recurring task in many contemporary areas in the Life Sciences. The availability of accessible cross-platform data analysis tools for such fundamental tasks in varied projects and environments is an important prerequisite to ensuring a reliable and timely turnaround as well as to provide practical analytical tools for student training. Results: We have developed an easy-to-use, interactive software tool for the analysis of multiple data sets comprising replicates of discrete bivariate data points. For each dataset, the software identifies the replicate data points from a defined matrix layout and calculates their means and standard errors. The averaged values are then automatically fitted using either a linear or a logistic dose response function. Conclusions: DRfit is a practical and convenient tool for the analysis of one or multiple sets of discrete data points acquired as replicates from multi-well plate assays. The design of the graphical user interface and the built-in analysis features make it a flexible and useful tool for a wide range of different assays.",
