    "description": "Ridge regression (RR) is a regularization technique that penalizes the L2-norm of the coefficients in linear regression. One of the challenges of using RR is the need to set a hyperparameter (\u03b1) that controls the amount of regularization. Cross-validation is typically used to select the best \u03b1 from a set of candidates. However, efficient and appropriate selection of \u03b1 can be challenging, particularly where large amounts of data are analyzed. Because the selected \u03b1 depends on the scale of the data and predictors, it is also not straightforwardly interpretable.\n\nIn fracridge, we reparameterize RR in terms of the ratio \u03b3 between the L2-norms of the regularized and unregularized coefficients. This approach, called fractional RR (FRR), has several benefits: the solutions obtained for different \u03b3 are guaranteed to vary, guarding against wasted calculations, and automatically span the relevant range of regularization, avoiding the need for arduous manual exploration.",
