                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications and has frequently demonstrated its suitability as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. In addition to chip and sequencing based epigenome wide methylation profiling methods, targeted bisulfite sequencing (TBS) has been established as a cost-effective approach for routine diagnostics and target validation applications. Yet, an easy-to-use tool for the analysis of TBS data in combination with array-based methylation results has been missing. Consequently, we have developed EPIC-TABSAT, a user-friendly web-based application for the analysis of targeted sequencing data that additionally allows the integration of array-based methylation results. The tool can handle multiple targets as well as multiple sequencing files in parallel and covers the complete data analysis workflow from calculation of quality metrics to methylation calling and interactive result presentation. The graphical user interface offers an unprecedented way to interpret TBS data alone or in combination with array-based methylation studies. Together with the computation of target-specific epialleles it is useful in validation, research, and routine diagnostic environments. EPIC-TABSAT is freely accessible to all users at https://tabsat.ait.ac.at/.",
