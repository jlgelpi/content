This dataset is made up of two collections, the General collection (61,377 specimens) and the Historical collection (1,614 specimens). This study has focused mainly on the General collection, which contains the largest number of vascular plant specimens, predominantly angiosperms, mainly provincial and regional (Andalusia, Spain), but also with a good representation of other areas of the Iberian Peninsula and neighboring countries. The place of collection is specified in 99.7% of the labels, about 35% being georeferenced, and it is estimated that, currently, about 86% of the material housed in the herbarium has been databased using Elysia v1.0. software. With more than 178 families, 1,178 genera, and 3,750 species, this collection not only has educational importance, but is a valuable research tool that has been useful for the development of important works such as \"Flora Vascular de Andaluc\u00eda Occidental\" and the \"Flora iberica\". The dataset described in this paper is registered with GBIF.",
