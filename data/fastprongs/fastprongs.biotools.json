                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: Next-generation sequencing technology is developing rapidly and the vast amount of data that is generated needs to be preprocessed for downstream analyses. However, until now, software that can efficiently make all the quality assessments and filtration of raw data is still lacking. Results: We developed FastProNGS to integrate the quality control process with automatic adapter removal. Parallel processing was implemented to speed up the process by allocating multiple threads. Compared with similar up-to-date preprocessing tools, FastProNGS is by far the fastest. Read information before and after filtration can be output in plain-text, JSON, or HTML formats with user-friendly visualization. Conclusions: FastProNGS is a rapid, standardized, and user-friendly tool for preprocessing next-generation sequencing data within minutes. It is an all-in-one software that is convenient for bulk data analysis. It is also very flexible and can implement different functions using different user-set parameter combinations.",
