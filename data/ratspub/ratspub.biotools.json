Over 300 of these keywords are organized into six categories:.\n\nRatsPub is a tool to efficiently and comprehensively answer the question \"What do we know about these genes and addiction?\".\n\nRatsPub answers this question by searching PubMed to find sentences containing the query terms (i.e., gene symbols) and over 300 drug addiction-related keywords that are organized into six categories. Data from NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog are also included in the search. These gene-keyword relationships are presented as an interactive graph and a table.",
