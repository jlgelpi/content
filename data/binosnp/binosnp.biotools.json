    "description": "An R workflow for detection of low-frequency resistance-mediating SNPs in next-generation sequencing data of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains with binoSNP.\n\nAccurate drug resistance detection is key for guiding effective tuberculosis treatment. While genotypic resistance can be rapidly detected by molecular methods, their application is challenged by mixed mycobacterial populations comprising both susceptible and resistant cells (heteroresistance). For this, next-generation sequencing (NGS) based approaches promise the determination of variants even at low frequencies. However, accurate methods for a valid detection of low-frequency variants in NGS data are currently lacking. To tackle this problem, we developed the variant detection tool binoSNP which allows the determination of low-frequency single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NGS datasets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains.",
