    "description": "Sequence-based method to predict the binding free energy change of protein-protein complexes upon mutation using functional classification.\n\nThis server predicts protein-protein binding affinity change upon mutation using sequence-based features and functional class. ProAffiMuSeq shows a correlation of 0.73 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.86 kcal/mol in cross-validation. In the test dataset, the performance remains consistent with a correlation of 0.75 with MAE of 0.94 kcal/mol. In a blind dataset of 473 mutations (Geng et al. 2019, Proteins 87, 110-119) it showed a correlation and MAE of 0.27 and 1.06 kcal/mol, respectively, comparable to structure-based methods. Further, our method showed a MAE of 1.21 kcal/mol, when tested with a set of 552 additional non-redundant interface mutations in 80 complexes deposited in SKEMPI 2.0 (Jankauskait\u0117 et al. 2019, Bioinformatics 35, 462-469)",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: Protein-protein interactions are essential for the cell and mediate various functions. However, mutations can disrupt these interactions and may cause diseases. Currently available computational methods require a complex structure as input for predicting the change in binding affinity. Further, they have not included the functional class information for the protein-protein complex. To address this, we have developed a method, ProAffiMuSeq, which predicts the change in binding free energy using sequence-based features and functional class. Results: Our method shows an average correlation between predicted and experimentally determined \u0394\u0394G of 0.73 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.86 kcal/mol in 10-fold cross-validation and correlation of 0.75 with MAE of 0.94 kcal/mol in the test dataset. ProAffiMuSeq was also tested on an external validation set and showed results comparable to structure-based methods. Our method can be used for large-scale analysis of disease-causing mutations in protein-protein complexes without structural information.",
