Computational prediction of TF binding sites is challenging, because TFs often bind only to short DNA motifs and cell-type specific co-factors may work together with the same TF to determine binding. Here, we consider the problem of learning a general model for the prediction of TF binding using DNase1-seq data and TF motif description in form of position specific energy matrices (PSEMs). Methods: We use TF ChIP-seq data as a gold-standard for model training and evaluation. Our contribution is a novel ensemble learning approach using random forest classifiers. In the context of the ENCODE-DREAM in vivo TF binding site prediction challenge we consider different learning setups. Results: Our results indicate that the ensemble learning approach is able to better generalize across tissues and cell-types compared to individual tissue-specific classifiers or a classifier built based upon data aggregated across tissues. Furthermore, we show that incorporating DNase1-seq peaks is essential to reduce the false positive rate of TF binding predictions compared to considering the raw DNase1 signal. Conclusions: Analysis of important features reveals that the models preferentially select motifs of other TFs that are close interaction partners in existing protein protein-interaction networks.
