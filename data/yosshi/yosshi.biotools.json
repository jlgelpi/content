                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Disulfide bonds play a significant role in protein stability, function or regulation but are poorly conserved among evolutionarily related proteins. The Yosshi can help to understand the role of S-S bonds by comparing sequences and structures of homologs with diverse properties and different disulfide connectivity patterns within a common structural fold of a superfamily, and assist to select the most promising hot-spots to improve stability of proteins/enzymes or modulate their functions by introducing naturally occurring crosslinks. The bioinformatic analysis is supported by the integrated Mustguseal web-server to construct large structure-guided sequence alignments of functionally diverse protein families that can include thousands of proteins based on all available information in public databases. The Yosshi+Mustguseal is a new integrated web-tool for a systematic homology-driven analysis and engineering of S-S bonds that facilitates a broader interpretation of disulfides not just as a factor of structural stability, but rather as a mechanism to implement functional diversity within a superfamily. The results can be downloaded as a content-rich PyMol session file or further studied online using the HTML5-based interactive analysis tools. Both web-servers are free and open to all users at https://biokinet.belozersky.msu.ru/yosshi and there is no login requirement.",
