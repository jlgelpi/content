    "description": "Circular RNA Prediction based on Junction Encoders and Deep Interaction among Splice Sites.\n\nAbstract Circular RNA is a novel class of endogenous non-coding RNAs that have been largely discovered in eukaryotic transcriptome. The circular structure arises from a non-canonical splicing process, where the donor site backsplices to an upstream acceptor site. These circular form of RNAs are conserved across species, and often show tissue or cell-specific expression. Emerging evidences have suggested its vital roles in gene regulation, which are further associated with various types of diseases. As the fundamental effort to elucidate its function and mechanism, numerous efforts have been devoted to predicting circular RNA from its primary sequence",
