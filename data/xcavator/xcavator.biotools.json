Results: By using simulated and real datasets we showed that our tool, based on read count approach, is capable to predict the boundaries and the absolute number of DNA copies CNVs/CNAs with high resolutions. To demonstrate the power of our software we applied it to the analysis Illumina and Pacific Bioscencies data and we compared its performance to other ten state of the art tools. Conclusion: All the analyses we performed demonstrate that XCAVATOR is capable to detect germline and somatic CNVs/CNAs outperforming all the other tools we compared. XCAVATOR is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/xcavator/.",
