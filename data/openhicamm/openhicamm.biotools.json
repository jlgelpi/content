                "abstract": "\u00a9 2018 The AuthorsHigh-content image acquisition is generally limited to cells grown in culture, requiring complex hardware and preset imaging modalities. Here we report an open source software package, OpenHiCAMM (Open Hi Content Acquisition for \u03bcManager), that provides a flexible framework for integration of generic microscope-associated robotics and image processing with sequential workflows. As an example, we imaged Drosophila embryos, detecting the embryos at low resolution, followed by re-imaging the detected embryos at high resolution, suitable for computational analysis and screening. The OpenHiCAMM package is easy to use and adapt for automating complex microscope image tasks. It expands our abilities for high-throughput image-based screens to a new range of biological samples, such as organoids, and will provide a foundation for bioimaging systems biology. \u00a9 2018 The AuthorsOptical Imaging; Technical Aspects of Cell Biology; Bioinformatics",
