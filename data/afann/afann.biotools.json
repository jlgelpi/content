However, in this study, we show that alignment-free dissimilarity calculated based on sequencing samples can be overestimated compared with the dissimilarity calculated based on their genomes, and this bias can significantly decrease the performance of the alignment-free analysis. Here, we introduce a new alignment-free tool, Alignment-Free methods Adjusted by Neural Network (Afann) that successfully adjusts this bias and achieves excellent performance on various independent datasets. Afann is freely available at https://github.com/GeniusTang/Afann.",
