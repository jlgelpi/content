    "description": "A Rational Biological Cell Factory Targeting Platform for Biosynthetic Target Chemicals | Chassis selection from 70 candidate orgainisms for more than 6,000 target molecules production | CF-Targrter: We present CF-Targeter to solve several biological problems, including host organism selection, biosynthetic pathway design and quantitative evaluations of pathways. It is very useful for those who plan to biosynthesize a target molecule but do not know which host organism should be selected, what the heterologous pathway is or what maximum theoretical yields could be achieved | Tips: please choose a search type",
