    "description": "annotation of metabolite origins via networks to integrate microbiome and metabolome data.\n\nAnnotation of Metabolite Origin via Networks: A tool for predicting putative metabolite origins for microbes or between microbes and host with or without metabolomics data.\n\nIt is recommended to install AMON in a conda environment. The environment can be created by first downloading the environment file.\n\nA command line tool for predicting the compounds produced by microbes and the host.\n\nAMON includes two scripts. extract_ko_genome_from_organism.py takes a KEGG organism flat file and makes a list of KOs present in that file. AMON.py predicts the metabolites that could be produced by the KOs used as input. This can be compared to the KOs present in the host or from some other gene set as well as to as set of KEGG metabolites",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: Untargeted metabolomics of host-associated samples has yielded insights into mechanisms by which microbes modulate health. However, data interpretation is challenged by the complexity of origins of the small molecules measured, which can come from the host, microbes that live within the host, or from other exposures such as diet or the environment. Results: We address this challenge through development of AMON: Annotation of Metabolite Origins via Networks. AMON is an open-source bioinformatics application that can be used to annotate which compounds in the metabolome could have been produced by bacteria present or the host, to evaluate pathway enrichment of host verses microbial metabolites, and to visualize which compounds may have been produced by host versus microbial enzymes in KEGG pathway maps. Conclusions: AMON empowers researchers to predict origins of metabolites via genomic information and to visualize potential host:microbe interplay. Additionally, the evaluation of enrichment of pathway metabolites of host versus microbial origin gives insight into the metabolic functionality that a microbial community adds to a host:microbe system. Through integrated analysis of microbiome and metabolome data, mechanistic relationships between microbial communities and host phenotypes can be better understood.",
