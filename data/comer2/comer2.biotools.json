    "description": "GPU-accelerated sensitive and specific homology searches.\n\nCOMER2, cross-platform software for protein remote homology search.\n\nThe COMER method based on sequence profile-profile comparison is one of the most sensitive and accurate computational tools developed for protein alignment and homology search. COMER version 2.1 (COMER2) represents one of the fastest implementations of calculations for sensitive protein homology search. High COMER2 performance is achieved by harnessing the power of the Graphics processing unit (GPU). Hence, a GPU is expected to be installed on the system.\n\nCOMER2, a cross-platform software package for protein remote homology search and alignment.",

We present a completely rewritten version of the sensitive homology search method COMER based on alignment of protein sequence profiles, which is capable of searching big databases even on a lightweight laptop. By harnessing the power of CUDA-enabled graphics processing units, it is up to 20 times faster than HHsearch, a state-of-the-art method using vectorized instructions on modern CPUs.
