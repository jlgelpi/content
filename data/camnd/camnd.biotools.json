    "description": "Comparative analysis of metabolic network decomposition based on previous and two new criteria.\n\nMetabolic networks can model the behavior of metabolism in the cell. Since analyzing the whole metabolic networks is not easy, network modulation is an important issue to be investigated. Decomposing metabolic networks is a strategy to obtain better insight into metabolic functions. Additionally, decomposing these networks facilitates using computational methods, which are very slow when applied to the original genome-scale network. Several methods have been proposed for decomposing of the metabolic network. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate these methods by suitable criteria.",
