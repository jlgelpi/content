                "abstract": "\u00a9 2017 The Author(s).Genome guided discovery of novel natural products has been a promising approach for identification of new bioactive compounds. SBSPKS web-server has been a valuable resource for analysis of polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters. We have developed an updated version - SBSPKSv2 which is based on comprehensive analysis of sequence, structure and secondary metabolite chemical structure data from 311 experimentally characterized PKS/NRPS gene clusters with known biosynthetic products. A completely new feature of SBSPKSv2 is the inclusion of features for search in chemical space. It allows the user to compare the chemical structure of a given secondary metabolite to the chemical structures of biosynthetic intermediates and final products. For identification of catalytic domains, SBSPKS now uses profile based searches, which are computationally faster and have high sensitivity. HMM profiles have also been added for a number of new domains and motif information has been used for distinguishing condensation (C), epimerization (E) and cyclization (Cy) domains of NRPS. In summary, the new and updated SBSPKSv2 is a versatile tool for genome mining and analysis of polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide biosynthetic pathways in chemical space.",
