Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.MyDGR is a web server providing integrated prediction and visualization of Diversity-Generating Retroelements (DGR) systems in query nucleotide sequences. It is built upon an enhanced version of DGRscan, a tool we previously developed for identification of DGR systems. DGR systems are remarkable genetic elements that use error-prone reverse transcriptases to generate vast sequence variants in specific target genes, which have been shown to benefit their hosts (bacteria, archaea or phages). As the first web server for annotation of DGR systems, myDGR is freely available on the web at http://omics.informatics.Indiana.edu/myDGR with all major browsers supported. MyDGR accepts query nucleotide sequences in FASTA format, and outputs all the important features of a predicted DGR system, including a reverse transcriptase, a template repeat and one (or more) variable repeats and their alignment featuring A-to-N (N can be C, T or G) substitutions, and VR-containing target gene(s). In addition to providing the results as text files for download, myDGR generates a visual summary of the results for users to explore the predicted DGR systems. Users can also directly access pre-calculated, putative DGR systems identified in currently available reference bacterial genomes and a few other collections of sequences (including human microbiomes).",
