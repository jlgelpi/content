It is an active member of the International Molecular Exchange (IMEx) consortium and has adopted the PSIMI standards for annotating and exchanging interaction data, either at the MIMIx or IMEx level. MatrixDB content has been updated by curation and by importing extracellular interaction data fromother IMEx databases. Othermajor changes include the creation of a new website and the development of a novel graphical navigator, iNavigator, to build and expand interaction networks. Filters may be applied to build sub-networks based on a list of biomolecules, a specified interaction detection method and/or an expression level by tissue, developmental stage, and health state (UniGene data). Any molecule of the network may be selected and its partners added to the network at any time. Networks may be exported under Cytoscape and tabular formats and as images, and may be saved for subsequent re-use.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.MatrixDB (http://matrixdb.univ-lyon1.fr/) is an interaction database focused on biomolecular interactions established by extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). It is an active member of the International Molecular Exchange (IMEx) consortium (https://www.imexconsortium.org/). It has adopted the HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative standards for annotating and exchanging interaction data, either at the MIMIx (The Minimum Information about a Molecular Interaction eXperiment) or IMEx level. The following items related to GAGs have been added in the updated version of MatrixDB: (i) cross-references of GAG sequences to the GlyTouCan database, (ii) representation of GAG sequences in different formats (IUPAC and GlycoCT) and as SNFG (Symbol Nomenclature For Glycans) images and (iii) the GAG Builder online tool to build 3D models of GAG sequences from GlycoCT codes. The database schema has been improved to represent n-Ary experiments. Gene expression data, imported from Expression Atlas (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home), quantitative ECM proteomic datasets (http://matrisomeproject.mit.edu/ecm-Atlas), and a new visualization tool of the 3D structures of biomolecules, based on the PDB Component Library and LiteMol, have also been added. A new advanced query interface now allows users to mine MatrixDB data using combinations of criteria, in order to build specific interaction networks related to diseases, biological processes, molecular functions or publications.",
