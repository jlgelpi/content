Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is emerging as an important layer of gene regulation because the majority of mammalian protein-coding genes contain multiple polyadenylation (pA) sites in their 3' UTR. By alteration of 3' UTR length, APA can considerably affect post-transcriptional gene regulation. Yet, our understanding of APA remains rudimentary. Novel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques allow molecular characterization of different cell types to an unprecedented degree. Notably, the most popular scRNA-seq protocols specifically sequence the 3' end of transcripts. Building on this property, we implemented a method for analysing patterns of APA regulation from such data. Analyzing multiple datasets from diverse tissues, we identified widespread modulation of APA in different cell types resulting in global 3' UTR shortening/lengthening and enhanced cleavage at intronic pA sites. Our results provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that the huge volume of scRNA-seq data that accumulates in the public domain offers a unique resource for the exploration of APA based on a very broad collection of cell types and biological conditions.",
