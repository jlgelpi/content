    "description": "an lncRNA functional similarity calculation model based on an improved disease semantic similarity method.\n\nBACKGROUND:It has been widely accepted that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the development and progression of human diseases. Many association prediction models have been proposed for predicting lncRNA functions and identifying potential lncRNA-disease associations. Nevertheless, among them, little effort has been attempted to measure lncRNA functional similarity, which is an essential part of association prediction models. RESULTS:In this study, we presented an lncRNA functional similarity calculation model, IDSSIM for short, based on an improved disease semantic similarity method, highlight of which is the introduction of information content contribution factor into the semantic value calculation to take into account both the hierarchical structures of disease directed acyclic graphs and the disease specificities",
