    "description": "An automatic data mining tool based on a consistent voting method with a user-friendly graphical interface.\n\nIn order to extract useful information from a huge amount of biological data nowadays, simple and convenient tools are urgently needed for data analysis and modeling. In this paper, an automatic data mining tool, termed as ABCModeller (Automatic Binary Classification Modeller), with a user-friendly graphical interface was developed here, which includes automated functions as data preprocessing, significant feature extraction, classification modeling, model evaluation and prediction. In order to enhance the generalization ability of the final model, a consistent voting method was built here in this tool with the utilization of three popular machine-learning algorithms, as artificial neural network, support vector machine and random forest.",
