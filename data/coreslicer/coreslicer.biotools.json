                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: Analytic morphomics, or more simply, \"morphomics,\" refers to the measurement of specific biomarkers of body composition from medical imaging, most commonly computed tomography (CT) images. An emerging body of literature supports the use of morphomic markers measured on single-slice CT images for risk prediction in a range of clinical populations. However, uptake by healthcare providers been limited due to the lack of clinician-friendly software to facilitate measurements. The objectives of this study were to describe the interface and functionality of CoreSlicer- a free and open-source web-based interface aiming to facilitate measurement of analytic morphomics by clinicians - and to validate muscle and fat measurements performed in CoreSlicer against reference software. Results: Measurements of muscle and fat obtained in CoreSlicer show high agreement with established reference software. CoreSlicer features a full set of DICOM viewing tools and extensible plugin interface to facilitate rapid prototyping and validation of new morphomic markers by researchers. We present published studies illustrating the use of CoreSlicer by clinicians with no prior knowledge of medical image segmentation techniques and no formal training in radiology, where CoreSlicer was successfully used to predict operative risk in three distinct populations of cardiovascular patients. Conclusions: CoreSlicer enables extraction of morphomic markers from CT images by non-technically skilled clinicians. Measurements were reproducible and accurate in relation to reference software.",
