    "description": "A Federated, Privacy-Preserving Tool as a Robust Alternative to Meta-Analysis in Genome-Wide Association Studies.\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to unravel connections between genetic variants and diseases. Larger sample sizes in GWAS can lead to discovering more associations and more accurate genetic predictors. However, sharing and combining distributed genomic data to increase the sample size is often challenging or even impossible due to privacy concerns and privacy protection laws such as the GDPR. While meta-analysis has been established as an effective approach to combine summary statistics of several GWAS, its accuracy can be attenuated in the presence of cross-study heterogeneity. Here, we present sPLINK ( safe PLINK ), a user-friendly tool, which performs federated GWAS on distributed datasets while preserving the privacy of data and the accuracy of the results. sPLINK neither exchanges raw data nor does it rely on summary statistics",
