    "description": "An R Platform for Multi-locus Genome-wide Association Studies.\n\nMulti-Locus Random-SNP-Effect Mixed Linear Model Tools for Genome-Wide Association Study with Graphical User Interface.\n\nConduct multi-locus genome-wide association study under the framework of multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM). First, each marker on the genome is scanned. Bonferroni correction is replaced by a less stringent selection criterion for significant test. Then, all the markers that are potentially associated with the trait are included in a multi-locus genetic model, their effects are estimated by empirical Bayes and all the nonzero effects were further identified by likelihood ratio test for true QTL.
