    "description": "Antigen receptors are characterized by an extreme diversity of specificities, which poses major computational and analytical challenges, particularly in the era of high-throughput immunoprofiling by next generation sequencing (NGS). The antigen receptor gene profiler tool (TRIP) offers the opportunity for an in-depth analysis based on the processing of the output files of the IMGT/HighV-Quest tool, a standard in NGS immunoprofiling, through a number of interoperable modules. These  provide  detailed  information about antigen receptor gene rearrangements, including variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene usage, CDR3 amino acid and nucleotide composition and clonality of both T cell receptors (TR) and B cell receptor immunoglobulins (BcR IG), and characteristics of the somatic hypermutation within the BcR IG genes. TRIP is a web application implemented in R shiny.",
