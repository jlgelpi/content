    "description": "Identifying disease-associated signaling pathways through a novel effector gene analysis.\n\nSignaling pathway analysis methods are commonly used to explain biological behaviors of disease cells. Effector genes typically decide functional attributes (associated with biological behaviors of disease cells) by abnormal signals they received. The signals that the effector genes receive can be quite different in normal vs. disease conditions. However, most of current signaling pathway analysis methods do not take these signal variations into consideration. Methods:In this study, we developed a novel signaling pathway analysis method called signaling pathway functional attributes analysis (SPFA) method. This method analyzes the signal variations that effector genes received between two conditions (normal and disease) in different signaling pathways",
