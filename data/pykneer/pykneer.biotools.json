    "description": "An image analysis workflow for open and reproducible research on femoral knee cartilage.\n\nTransparent research in musculoskeletal imaging is fundamental to reliably investigate diseases such as knee osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic disease impairing femoral knee cartilage. To study cartilage degeneration, researchers have developed algorithms to segment femoral knee cartilage from magnetic resonance (MR) images and to measure cartilage morphology and relaxometry. The majority of these algorithms are not publicly available or require advanced programming skills to be compiled and run. However, to accelerate discoveries and findings, it is crucial to have open and reproducible workflows. We present pyKNEEr, a framework for open and reproducible research on femoral knee cartilage from MR images. pyKNEEr is written in python, uses Jupyter notebook as a user interface, and is available on GitHub with a GNU GPLv3 license",
