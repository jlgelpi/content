We have developed a user-friendly, open-source ImageJ plugin that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for super-resolution measurement of thin filament lengths by applying Distributed Deconvolution (DDecon) analysis to periodic line scans collected from fluorescence images. In the workflow presented here, we demonstrate thin filament length measurement using a phalloidin-stained cryosection of mouse skeletal muscle. The DDecon plugin is also capable of measuring distances of any periodically localized fluorescent signal from the Z- or M-line, as well as distances between successive Z- or M-lines, providing a broadly applicable tool for quantitative analysis of muscle cytoarchitecture. These functionalities can also be used to analyse periodic fluorescence signals in nonmuscle cells.",
