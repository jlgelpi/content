Includes functions for the analysis of the introduced randomness across the switching steps and several other routines to analyse the resulting networks and their natural projections.",

                "abstract": "Motivation: Studying combinatorial patterns in cancer genomic datasets has recently emerged as a tool for identifying novel cancer driver networks. Approaches have been devised to quantify, for example, the tendency of a set of genes to be mutated in a 'mutually exclusive' manner. The significance of the proposed metrics is usually evaluated by computing P-values under appropriate null models. To this end, a Monte Carlo method (the switching-Algorithm) is used to sample simulated datasets under a null model that preserves patient-and genewise mutation rates. In this method, a genomic dataset is represented as a bipartite network, to which Markov chain updates (switchingsteps) are applied. These steps modify the network topology, and a minimal number of them must be executed to draw simulated datasets independently under the null model. This number has previously been deducted empirically to be a linear function of the total number of variants, making this process computationally expensive. Results: We present a novel approximate lower bound for the number of switching-steps, derived analytically. Additionally, we have developed the R package BiRewire, including new efficient implementations of the switching-Algorithm. We illustrate the performances of BiRewire by applying it to large real cancer genomics datasets. We report vast reductions in time requirement, with respect to existing implementations/bounds and equivalent P-value computations. Thus, we propose BiRewire to study statistical properties in genomic datasets, and other data that can be modeled as bipartite networks.. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2014.",
