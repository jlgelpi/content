                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: Balancer chromosomes are tools used by fruit fly geneticists to prevent meiotic recombination. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has been shown capable of generating inversions similar to the chromosomal rearrangements present in balancer chromosomes. Extending the benefits of balancer chromosomes to other multicellular organisms could significantly accelerate biomedical and plant genetics research. Results: Here, we present GRIBCG (Guide RNA Identifier for Balancer Chromosome Generation), a tool for the rational design of balancer chromosomes. GRIBCG identifies single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for use with Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). These sgRNAs would efficiently cut a chromosome multiple times while minimizing off-target cutting in the rest of the genome. We describe the performance of this tool on six model organisms and compare our results to two routinely used fruit fly balancer chromosomes. Conclusion: GRIBCG is the first of its kind tool for the design of balancer chromosomes using CRISPR/Cas9. GRIBCG can accelerate genetics research by providing a fast, systematic and simple to use framework to induce chromosomal rearrangements.",
