    "description": "Facilitating the analysis of COVID-19 host genetics.\n\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has demanded an unprecedented scientific response, with researchers collaborating on a global scale to better understand how host genetics can influence susceptibility to coronavirus infection and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. The number of projects directed towards sequencing patients\u2019 genomes has increased rapidly during this time with the rate of data generation outpacing the resources available for analysis and biological interpretation of these datasets. SNPnexus COVID is a cutting-edge web-based analytical platform that allows researchers to analyse and interpret the functional implications of genetic variants in COVID-19 patient genomes and to prioritise those that demonstrate clinical utility for the prevention, management and or treatment of COVID-19",
