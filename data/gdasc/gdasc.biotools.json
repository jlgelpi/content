    "description": "A GPU parallel-based web server for detecting hidden batch factors.\n\nIt provides a user-friendly web interface for detecting batch factors. Based on the good performance of DASC algorithm, it is able to give the most accurate results. For two steps of DASC, data-adaptive shrinkage and semi-non-negative matrix factorization, we designed parallelization strategies facing convex clustering solution and decomposition process. It runs more than 50 times faster than the original version on the representative RNA sequencing quality control dataset. With its accuracy and high speed, this server will be a useful tool for batch effects analysis.",
