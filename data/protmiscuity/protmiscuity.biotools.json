    "description": "a database of promiscuous proteins.\n\nPromiscuous behaviour in proteins and enzymes remains a challenging feature to understand the structure-function relationship. Here we present ProtMiscuity, a manually curated online database of proteins showing catalytic promiscuity. ProtMiscuity contains information about canonical and promiscuous activities comprising 88 different reactions in 57 proteins from 40 different organisms. It can be searched or browsed by protein names, organisms and descriptions of canonical and promiscuous reactions. Entries provide information on reaction substrates, products and kinetic parameters, mapping of active sites to sequence and structure and links to external resources with biological and functional annotations.",
