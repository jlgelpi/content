    "description": "An operational online three-dimensional forecasting platform for lake hydrodynamics.\n\nThe online platform for monitoring and forecasting the bio-physical state of Swiss lakes.\n\nThis product is developed, managed and maintained by Theo Baracchini and part of his PhD thesis. The application shares with the public some results of 3D hydrodynamic-biological simulations performed daily with the Delft3D modelling framework on a compute server. Additionally, it displays measurements from a field station with data connexion and remote sensing images downloaded from satellites in real-time.",
