    "description": "Takes the amino acid sequence of the query protein as input. It first creates multiple threading alignments to recognize homologous and analogous template structures, from which a domain conservation score is then calculated for deducing the domain boundaries. Next, a boundary clustering method is used to optimize the domain model selections. For discontinuous domain structures, a symmetric alignment algorithm is applied to further integrate and refine the domain assignments.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2017 The Author(s).We develop a hierarchical pipeline, ThreaDomEx, for both continuous domain (CD) and discontinuous domain (DCD) structure predictions. Starting from a query sequence, ThreaDomEx first threads it through the PDB to identify multiple structure templates, where a profile of domain conservation score (DCscore) is derived for domain-segment assignment. To further detect DCDs that consist of separated segments along the sequence, a boundary-clustering algorithm is used to refine the DCD-linker locations. In case that the templates do not contain DCDs, a domain-segment assembly process, guided by symmetry comparison, is applied for further DCD detections. ThreaDomEx was tested a set of 1111 proteins and achieved a normalized domain overlap score of 89.3% compared to experimental data, which is significantly higher than other state-of-the-art methods. It also recalls 26.7% of DCDs with 72.7% precision on the proteins for which threading failed to detect any DCDs. The server provides facilities for users to interactively refine the domain models by adjusting DCscore threshold, deleting and adding domain linkers, and assembling domain segments, which are particularly helpful for the hard targets for which current methods have a low accuracy while human-expert knowledge and experimental insights can be used for refining models.",
