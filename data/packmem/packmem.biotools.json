                "abstract": "\u00a9 2018 Biophysical SocietyThe analysis of the structural organization of lipid bilayers is generally performed across the direction normal to the bilayer/water interface, whereas the surface properties of the bilayer at the interface with water are often neglected. Here, we present PackMem, a bioinformatic tool that performs a topographic analysis of the bilayer surface from various molecular dynamics simulations. PackMem unifies and rationalizes previous analyses based on a Cartesian grid. The grid allows identification of surface regions defined as lipid-packing defects where lipids are loosely packed, leading to cavities in which aliphatic carbons are exposed to the solvent, either deep inside or close to the membrane surface. Examples are provided to show that the abundance of lipid-packing defects varies according to the temperature and to the bilayer composition. Because lipid-packing defects control the adsorption of peripheral proteins with hydrophobic insertions, PackMem is instrumental for us to understand and quantify the adhesive properties of biological membranes as well as their response to mechanical perturbations such as membrane deformation.",
