    "description": "metaseqR2 provides an interface to several normalization and statistical testing packages for RNA-Seq gene expression data. Additionally, it creates several diagnostic plots, performs meta-analysis by combinining the results of several statistical tests and reports the results in an interactive way. In the new version, the underlying PANDORA algorithm has been extended with additional statistical analysis tools, the report has been completely redesigned and is fully ineractive, there is an annotation database building system and all actions run 5-50x faster.",
