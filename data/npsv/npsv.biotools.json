    "description": "NPSV is Python-based tool for stand-alone genotyping of deletion and insertion structural variants (SVs) in short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. NPSV implements a machine learning-based approach for SV genotyping that employs NGS simulation to model the combined effects of the genomic region, sequencer and alignment pipeline.",
