    "description": "A Bioinformatics Tool for Predicting Peptide Ligands of Potassium Channels Based on Primary Structure Information.\n\nPotassium channels play a key role in regulating the flow of ions through the plasma membrane, orchestrating many cellular processes including cell volume regulation, hormone secretion and electrical impulse formation. Ligand peptides of potassium channels are molecules used in basic and applied research and are now considered promising alternatives in the treatment of many diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Currently, there are various bioinformatics tools focused on the prediction of peptides with different activities. However, none of the current tools can predict ligand peptides of potassium channels. In this work, we developed a tool called PPLK+C; this is the first tool that can predict peptide ligands of potassium channels",
