    "description": "A Tool for Unifying Hearing Impairment Knowledge to Enhance Collaborative Research.\n\nThe Hearing Impairment Ontology (HIO) is a collaboratively developed resource by a group of experts in different aspects of hearing impairment (HI) to provide a common controlled HI terminology and concepts. The HIO will allow researchers and clinicians alike to readily access standardised HI-related knowledge in a single location and promote collaborations and HI information sharing, including epidemiological, socio-environmental, biomedical, genetic and phenotypic information. It is worth noting, this ontology provides an illustration of the adaptability of the Sickle Cell Disease Ontology framework for use in developing a disease-specific ontology.",
