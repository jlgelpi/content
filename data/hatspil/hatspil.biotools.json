The decreasing costs per analysis led to big amounts of generated data and to the subsequent improvement of software for the respective analyses. As a consequence, many approaches have been developed to chain different software in order to obtain reliable and reproducible workflows. However, the large range of applications for NGS approaches entails the challenge to manage many different workflows without losing reliability. Methods We here present a high-throughput sequencing pipeline (HaTSPiL), a Python-powered CLI tool designed to handle different approaches for data analysis with a high level of reliability. The software relies on the barcoding of filenames using a human readable naming convention that contains any information regarding the sample needed by the software to automatically choose different workflows and parameters. HaTSPiL is highly modular and customisable, allowing the users to extend its features for any specific need.
