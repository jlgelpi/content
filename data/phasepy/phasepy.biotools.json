    "description": "A Python based framework for fluid phase equilibria and interfacial properties computation.\n\nPhasepy is a Python based package for fluid phase equilibria and interfacial properties calculation from equation of state (EoS). Phasepy uses several tools (i.e., NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) allowing use Phasepy under Jupyter Notebooks. Phasepy models phase equilibria with the traditional \u03d5-\u03b3 and \u03d5-\u03d5 approaches, where \u03d5 (fugacity coefficient) can be modeled as a perfect gas, virial gas or EoS fluid, whereas \u03b3 (activity coefficient) can be described by conventional models (NRTL, Wilson, Redlich-Kister expansion, and the group contribution modified-UNIFAC). Interfacial properties are based on the square gradient theory couple to \u03d5-\u03d5 approach. The available EoSs are the cubic EoS family extended to mixtures through the quadratic, modified-Huron-Vidal, and Wong-Sandler mixing rules",
