This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Previously, we have introduced an improved version of jViz.RNA which enabled faster and more stable RNA visualization by employing compressed tree graphs. However, the new RNA representation and visualization method required a sophisticated mechanism of pseudoknot visualization. In this work, we present our novel pseudoknot classification and implementation of pseudoknot visualization in the context of the new RNA graph model. We then compare our approach with other RNA visualization software, and demonstrate jViz.RNA 4.0\u2019s benefits compared to other software. Additionally, we introduce interactive editing functionality into jViz.RNA and demonstrate its benefits in exploring and building RNA structures. The results presented highlight the new high degree of utility jViz.RNA 4.0 now offers. Users are now able to visualize pseudoknotted RNA, manipulate the resulting automatic layouts to suit their individual needs, and change both positioning and connectivity of the RNA molecules examined. Care was taken to limit overlap between structural elements, particularly in the case of pseudoknots to ensure an intuitive and informative layout of the final RNA structure.",
