This web site is freely available to all users and there is no login requirement. This server provides a suite of cis-regulatory motif analysis functions on DNA sequences, which are important to elucidation of the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation: (i) de novo motif finding for a given set of promoter sequences along with statistical scores for the predicted motifs derived based on information extracted from a control set, (ii) scanning motif instances of a query motif in provided genomic sequences, (iii) motif comparison and clustering of identified motifs, and (iv) co-occurrence analyses of query motifs in given promoter sequences. The server is powered by a backend computer cluster with over 150 computing nodes, and is particularly useful for motif prediction and analyses in prokaryotic genomes. We believe that DMINDA, as a new and comprehensive web server for cis-regulatory motif finding and analyses, will benefit the genomic research community in general and prokaryotic genome researchers in particular. \u00a9 2014 The Author(s).",

For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com Motivation: Motif identification and analyses are important and have been long-standing computational problems in bioinformatics. Substantial efforts have been made in this field during the past several decades. However, the lack of intuitive and integrative web servers impedes the progress of making effective use of emerging algorithms and tools. Results: Here we present an integrated web server, DMINDA 2.0, which contains: (i) five motif prediction and analyses algorithms, including a phylogenetic footprinting framework; (ii) 2125 species with complete genomes to support the above five functions, covering animals, plants and bacteria and (iii) bacterial regulon prediction and visualization. Availability and Implementation: DMINDA 2.0 is freely available at http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/DMINDA2. Contact: qin.ma@sdstate.edu.
