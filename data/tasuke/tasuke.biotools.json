The variation and read depth of multiple genomes, as well as annotations, can be shown simultaneously at various scales. The frequency of variants and depth of coverage are shown by gradational colors in a block whose size is variable from 1bp to 100kb.",

The variation and read depths of multiple genomes, as well as annotations, can be shown simultaneously at various scales. We demonstrate the use of TASUKE by applying it to 50 rice and 100 human genome resequencing datasets.Availability and implementation: The tasuke program package and user manual are available from http://tasuke.dna.affrc.go.jp/.
