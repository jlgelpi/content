All rights reserved.Motivation: Strand-seq is a specialized single-cell DNA sequencing technique centered around the directionality of single-stranded DNA. Computational tools for Strand-seq analyses must capture the strand-specific information embedded in these data. Results: Here we introduce breakpointR, an R/Bioconductor package specifically tailored to process and interpret single-cell strand-specific sequencing data obtained from Strand-seq. We developed breakpointR to detect local changes in strand directionality of aligned Strand-seq data, to enable fine-mapping of sister chromatid exchanges, germline inversion and to support global haplotype assembly. Given the broad spectrum of Strand-seq applications we expect breakpointR to be an important addition to currently available tools and extend the accessibility of this novel sequencing technique.
