    "description": "A Comprehensive Resource for Tautomerism Analyses.\n\nTautomer Structures Extracted from Experimental Literature.\n\nA spreadsheet (Tautomer_database_release_3a.xlsx file) with 5,977 structures extracted from experimental literature representing 2,819 cases of tautomeric tuples (mostly tautomer pairs but also a few triples and higher-order tuples). All structures have been annotated with experimental conditions, structure identifiers, bibliographic references and types of tautomerism involved. The structures and experiment-related data were extracted from a total of 171 publications, including reviews reporting on multiple primary studies. Minor correction of references uploaded on 2020-01-29 as version 3a. No scientific data were changed.\n\n2,819 Tautomeric Tuples Comprising 5,977 Structures.",
