                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s).Canonical \u03c0-helices are short, relatively unstable secondary structure elements found in proteins. They comprise seven or more residues and are present in 15% of all known protein structures, often in functionally important regions such as ligand- and ion-binding sites. Given their similarity to \u03b1-helices, the prediction of \u03c0-helices is a challenging task and none of the currently available secondary structure prediction methods tackle it. Here, we present PiPred, a neural network-based tool for predicting \u03c0-helices in protein sequences. By performing a rigorous benchmark we show that PiPred can detect \u03c0-helices with a per-residue precision of 48% and sensitivity of 46%. Interestingly, some of the \u03b1-helices mispredicted by PiPred as \u03c0-helices exhibit a geometry characteristic of \u03c0-helices. Also, despite being trained only with canonical \u03c0-helices, PiPred can identify 6-residue-long \u03b1/\u03c0-bulges. These observations suggest an even higher effective precision of the method and demonstrate that \u03c0-helices, \u03b1/\u03c0-bulges, and other helical deformations may impose similar constraints on sequences. PiPred is freely accessible at: https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/#/tools/quick2d. A standalone version is available for download at: https://github.com/labstructbioinf/PiPred, where we also provide the CB6133, CB513, CASP10, and CASP11 datasets, commonly used for training and validation of secondary structure prediction methods, with correctly annotated \u03c0-helices.",
