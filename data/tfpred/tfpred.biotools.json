    "description": "Predicting Preference of Transcription Factors for Methylated DNA Using Sequence Information.\n\nThe role of this page is a brief introduction to TFPred.\n\nTFPred is a webserver for the identification of transcription factors and transcription factors that prefer bind to methylated DNA. In the predictors, sequence-based methods were used to represent proteins. The support vector machine (SVM) and XGBoost were applied for model construction. For the differentiation of transcription factors and non-transcription factors, the accuracy of the 5-fold cross validation test and independent dataset test was 86.66% and 83.02%, respectively. For the classification of transcription factors that prefer methylated DNA and transcription factors that prefer non-methylated DNA, the accuracy of the 5-fold cross-validation test and independent dataset test was 71.58% and 68.87%, respectively. We hope the webserver could provide convenience for Biochemistry scholars.",
