The adaptively weighted Fisher's method (AW-Fisher), initially developed for omics applications but applicable for general meta-analysis, is an effective approach to combine P-values from K independent studies and to provide better biological interpretability by characterizing which studies contribute to the meta-analysis. Currently, AW-Fisher suffers from the lack of fast P-value computation and variability estimate of AW weights. When the number of studies K is large, the 3K - 1 possible differential expression pattern categories generated by AW-Fisher can become intractable. In this paper, we develop an importance sampling scheme with spline interpolation to increase the accuracy and speed of the P-value calculation. We also apply bootstrapping to construct a variability index for the AW-Fisher weight estimator and a co-membership matrix to categorize (cluster) differentially expressed genes based on their meta-patterns for intuitive biological investigations. Results: The superior performance of the proposed methods is shown in simulations as well as two real omics meta-analysis applications to demonstrate its insightful biological findings.",
