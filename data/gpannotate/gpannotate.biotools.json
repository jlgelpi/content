For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.comThis manuscript describes an open-source program, DrawGlycan-SNFG (version 2), that accepts IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemist)-condensed inputs to render Symbol Nomenclature For Glycans (SNFG) drawings. A wide range of local and global options enable display of various glycan/peptide modifications including bond breakages, adducts, repeat structures, ambiguous identifications etc. These facilities make DrawGlycan-SNFG ideal for integration into various glycoinformatics software, including glycomics and glycoproteomics mass spectrometry (MS) applications. As a demonstration of such usage, we incorporated DrawGlycan-SNFG into gpAnnotate, a standalone application to score and annotate individual MS/MS glycopeptide spectrum in different fragmentation modes. Availability and implementation: DrawGlycan-SNFG and gpAnnotate are platform independent. While originally coded using MATLAB, compiled packages are also provided to enable DrawGlycan-SNFG implementation in Python and Java. All programs are available from https://virtualglycome.org/drawglycan; https://virtualglycome.org/ gpAnnotate.",
