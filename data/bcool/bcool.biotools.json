All rights reserved.Several corrections have been made to the above article. \u2022 In the article abstract, the word 'read' has been replaced by the word 'sequence.' \u2022 The caption for figure 1 has been replaced with the following text: 'Four issues with k-mer-spectrum methods, and how Bcool handles them (blue half-arrows represent the paths of the graph on which given reads map). (1) Genomic k-mers may be appear weak because of their low abundance: by using a very low k-mer abundance threshold coupled with a unitig abundance threshold, Bcool retains low-abundance k-mers and manages to correct the reads that contain them. (2) Erroneous k-mers may appear solid because of their high abundance: Bcool detects the tip pattern produced by such solid erroneous k-mers and is therefore able to discard them (other erroneous k-mers are detected at the unitig filtering step). (3) Sequencing errors may be validated by genomic k-mers originating from other parts of the genome: by considering mappings globally, Bcool chooses the best path for each read, i.e. The one on which it maps with the smallest number of mismatches. (4) Multiple errors may occur on a k-mer, resulting in a large weak region: by using unitigs instead of k-mers to correct reads, Bwise is able to correct properly reads that contain several nearby errors' \u2022 On page 3 of the PDF, 'k-mers' has been replaced with 'kvalues.' \u2022 On page 5 of the PDF the 'correction ratio' has been corrected from '= (TP + FN)/(FN + TP)' to '= (TP + FN)/(FN + FP)' \u2022 The following sentence has been added to the Figure 6 caption: 'BFC and Musket ran out of memory an all full human datasets' \u2022 The reference given for 'Limasset, A. et al. (2017)' has been corrected to the following: Limasset, A. et al. (2017) Fast and Scalable Minimal Perfect Hashing for Massive Key Sets. In: Iliopolis, C.S. et al.
