    "description": "Systematic Identification of Cell-Cell Communication Networks in the Developing Brain.\n\nSince the generation of cell-type specific knockout models, the importance of inter-cellular communication between neural, vascular, and microglial cells during neural development has been increasingly appreciated. However, the extent of communication between these major cell populations remains to be systematically mapped. Here, we describe EMBRACE (embryonic brain cell extraction using FACS), a method to simultaneously isolate neural, mural, endothelial, and microglial cells to more than 94% purity in \u223c4 h. Utilizing EMBRACE we isolate, transcriptionally analyze, and build a cell-cell communication map of the developing mouse brain. We identify 1,710 unique ligand-receptor interactions between neural, endothelial, mural, and microglial cells in silico and experimentally confirm the APOE-LDLR, APOE-LRP1, VTN-KDR, and LAMA4-ITGB1 interactions in the E14.5 brain",
