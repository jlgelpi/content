It has been designed with (microbial) ecological data in mind, but can be applied in general to infer relationships between objects observed in different samples (for example between genes present or absent across organisms).\n\nCoNet - Co-occurrence Network inference.\n\nCoNet detects significant non-random patterns of co-occurrence (copresence and mutual exclusion) in incidence and abundance data.\n\n12th January 2018: Thanks to Lisa R\u00f6ttjers, there is now an R implementation of CoNet.",

Though CoNet was developed with microbial community data from sequencing experiments in mind, it is designed to be generic and can detect associations in any data set where biological entities (such as genes, metabolites or species) have been observed repeatedly. The CoNet app supports Cytoscape 2.x and 3.x and offers a variety of network inference approaches, which can also be combined. Here we briefly describe its main features and illustrate its use on microbial count data obtained by 16S rDNA sequencing of arctic soil samples. The CoNet app is available at: http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/conet.",
