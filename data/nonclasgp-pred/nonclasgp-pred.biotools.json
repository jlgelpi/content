    "description": "Robust and efficient prediction of non-classically secreted proteins by integrating subset-specific optimal models of imbalanced data.\n\nNonclassically secreted proteins (NCSPs) are proteins that are located in the extracellular environment although the lack of known signal peptides or secretion motifs. In this work, a new computational predictor was developed for NCSP prediction of gram-positive bacteria. The subset-specific optimal feature combination process was adopted to characterize the original data from different aspects, and all subdataset based models were integrated into a unified model NonClasGP-Pred, which achieved an excellent performance and outperformed state-of-the-art available toolkits.\n\nPrediction of non-classically secreted proteins of Gram-positive bacteria.",
