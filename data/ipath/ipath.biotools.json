    "description": "iPath is a web-based tool for the visualization and analysis of cellular pathways. Based on functional annotations (such as KEGG), it provides pathway maps for primary cellular metabolism as well as for some additional secondary metabolite synthesis and regulatory pathways. Users can map their own data onto these pathway maps. Due to its navigation and customization functions, iPATH allows users to easily explore and analyze the functional and metabolic capabilities of their (meta-)genomic data sets.",

In two other maps, iPath2.0 provides an overview of secondary metabolite biosynthesis and a hand-picked selection of important regulatory pathways and other functional modules, allowing a more general overview of protein functions in a genome or metagenome. iPath2.0\u2032s main interface is an interactive Flash-based viewer, which allows users to easily navigate and explore the complex pathway maps. In addition to the default pre-computed overview maps, iPath offers several data mapping tools. Users can upload various types of data and completely customize all nodes and edges of iPath2.0\u2032s maps. These customized maps give users an intuitive overview of their own data, guiding the analysis of various genomics and metagenomics projects. \u00a9 2011 The Author(s).",

Users can fully customize these networks and interactively explore them through its redesigned, fast and lightweight interface, which highlights general metabolic trends in multi-omics data. It also offers navigation at various levels of details to help users further investigate those trends and ultimately uncover novel biological insights. Support for multiple experimental conditions and time-series datasets, tools for generation of customization data, programmatic access, and a free user accounts system were introduced in this version to further streamline its workflow.",
