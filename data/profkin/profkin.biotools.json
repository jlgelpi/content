    "description": "A Comprehensive Web Server for Structure-based Kinase Selectivity Profiling.\n\nKinase profiling is an efficient strategy for kinase inhibitor discovery, polypharmacological drug discovery and drug repositioning. A variety of methods have been established for kinase profiling, of which the combined mode of experimental and computational approaches is attractive, particularly in the early drug discovery. With the increasing number of kinase-inhibitor complex structures, structure-based kinase profiling is of great interest. To fully exploit the potential of structure-based kinase profiling in drug discovery and drug repositioning, we developed a versatile web server, termed ProfKin, for structure-based kinase profiling for small molecules of interest, which is established based on an in-house comprehensive structural database (KinLigDB) of manually curated kinase-ligand complex structures and associated information.",
