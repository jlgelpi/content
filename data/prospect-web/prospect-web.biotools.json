    "description": "A web server for predicting protein histidine phosphorylation sites.\n\nBackground: Phosphorylation of histidine residues plays crucial roles in signaling pathways and cell metabolism in prokaryotes such as bacteria. While evidence has emerged that protein histidine phosphorylation also occurs in more complex organisms, its role in mammalian cells has remained largely uncharted. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop computational tools that are able to identify histidine phosphorylation sites. Result: Here, we introduce PROSPECT that enables fast and accurate prediction of proteome-wide histidine phosphorylation substrates and sites. Our tool is based on a hybrid method that integrates the outputs of two convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifiers and a random forest-based classifier",
