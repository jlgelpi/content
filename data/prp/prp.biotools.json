Published by Oxford University Press.Gene regulation is a highly complex and networked phenomenon where multiple tiers of control determine the cell state in a spatio-temporal manner. Among these, the transcription factors, DNA and histone modifications, and post-transcriptional control by small RNAs like miRNAs serve as major regulators. An understanding of the integrative and spatio-temporal impact of these regulatory factors can provide better insights into the state of a 'cell system'. Yet, there are limited resources available to this effect. Therefore, we hereby report an integrative information portal (Plant Regulomics Portal; PRP) for plants for the first time. The portal has been developed by integrating a huge amount of curated data from published sources, RNA-, methylome- and sRNA/miRNA sequencing, histone modifications and repeats, gene ontology, digital gene expression and characterized pathways. The key features of the portal include a regulatory search engine for fetching numerous analytical outputs and tracks of the abovementioned regulators and also a genome browser for integrated visualization of the search results. It also has numerous analytical features for analyses of transcription factors (TFs) and sRNA/miRNA, spot-specific methylation, gene expression and interactions and details of pathways for any given genomic element. It can also provide information on potential RdDM regulation, while facilitating enrichment analysis, generation of visually rich plots and downloading of data in a selective manner. Visualization of intricate biological networks is an important feature which utilizes the Neo4j Graph database making analysis of relationships and long-range system viewing possible. Till date, PRP hosts 571-GB processed data for four plant species namely Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa subsp. japonica, Zea mays and Glycine max. Database URL: https://scbb.ihbt.res.in/PRP.",
